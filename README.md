I'm a  MCA student who lives in the Nellore. I'm learning how to code. I love to design webpages and to write Articles .I am good at python and web technologies(React js ,jQuery)and also familiar with sql  .  It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.
